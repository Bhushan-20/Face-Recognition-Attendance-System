# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview
The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a Python-based project that automates the process of marking attendance using facial recognition technology. It leverages the **Haar Cascade** and **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithms** for face detection and recognition. The system efficiently stores attendance records in a **MySQL database**.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in images or live video streams.
- **Face Recognition:** Implements LBPH for recognizing registered faces.
- **Automatic Attendance Marking:** Recognized faces are logged into the database along with timestamps.
- **Database Integration:** Stores user details in a MySQL database.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Tkinter for an intuitive GUI.
- **Excel Export:** Saves attendance data into an Excel file for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Database:** MySQL
- **GUI:** Tkinter
